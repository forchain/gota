Technical Analysis Library
==

Why am I writing this Library?
--
There are several of reasons:
- It's a fantastic way to learn both golang and technical indicators (whether the indicators actually work is another matter)
- I find the code for the existing ta-lib very hard to read.
- Golang is reasonably fast and much more readable than C (for me at least)
